abstract = {Phylogenetics is a powerful tool for microbial epidemiology, but it is a tool that is often misused and misinterpreted by the field. Microbial epidemiologists are cautioned that in order to draw any inferences about the order of descent from a common ancestor it is necessary to correctly root a phylogenetic tree. Epidemiological samples of microbial populations typically include both ancestors and their descendants. In order to illustrate the relationships of those isolates, the phylogenetic method used must be able to detect zero-length branches. Unweighted Pair-Group Method (UPGMA) is the phylogenetic method that is most widely used in microbial epidemiology. Because UPGMA cannot detect zero length branches, and because it places the root of the tree based on a usually-false assumption, UPGMA is the worst possible choice among the several phylogenetic methods available. Because microbial epidemiology deals with relationships among strains within a species, rather than with relationships among species, recombination within those species can render phylogenetic trees meaningless and positively misleading. When there is evidence of significant recombination within the species of interest phylogenetic trees should not be used at all. Instead, alternative tools such as eBURST should be used to understand relationships among isolates.}

abstract = "{For many years, phylogenetics was a topic confined largely to systematics. However, after the “molecular revolution” phylogenies began to permeate nearly every branch of the biological sciences, and they have since become tools that are common throughout mainstream biology. Unfortunately, along with this shift came the realization that phylogenetic trees are prone to misinterpretation. A phylogenetic tree provides a particular type of narrative representation of evolutionary history (O'Hara 1992), and one needs to grasp “tree thinking” to correctly interpret this form of narrative.Systematists tend to take it for granted that a phylogenetic tree is straightforward to interpret. However, in the real world this is clearly not so, and tree thinking cannot be taken for granted (Sandvik 2008). As David Baum and Stacey Smith have noted in their recent book on Tree Thinking (p. xv), the basic issue is that: tree thinking runs counter to standard perceptions of evolution in popular culture. We do not know why it should be so, but we have learned from working with thousands of students that, without contrary training, people tend to have a one-dimensional and progressive view of evolution. We tend to tell evolution as a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Against that backdrop, phylogenetic trees are challenging; they are not linear but branching and fractal, with one beginning and many equally valid ends. Tree thinking is, in short, counterintuitive.}",
