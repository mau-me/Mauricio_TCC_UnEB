abstract={Data structures and algorithms represent an important area of computer science. Sometimes, however, they are too abstract for students to understand them only from the lecture. Therefore we were looking for a way how to explain at least some of them to students. In recent years, the use of digital games at all levels of education has come to the focus of researchers and educators. The advantage of this approach is, among others, learning in a natural and interesting way. Since there are still very few good-quality educational games, we have decided to design, implement and test our own mobile game for teaching the algorithm of inserting new nodes to an AVL tree. In this paper, we describe designing of the game as a learning tool and introduce the first results from testing the game in a university course.},

abstract={Computer Science students will often mention the steep learning curve when first starting to learn computing topics. It is apparent, albeit, necessary, and consequentially results in a high attrition rate of students pursuing a Computer Science related education. Learning computing concepts, particularly for students who have had little to no experience prior, can be very difficult. The workload is heavy and often very tedious, which leads to a corresponding lack of motivation to learn. Beyond the initial difficulties, students must take numbers of courses centered mostly on complex, conceptual topics. Courses that teach data structures and algorithms are required in most schools early on in a Computer Science student's college career, and much like the introduction courses, these can be tedious and difficult to grasp. Our goal is to provide an interesting, effective, and measurable tool for learning these concepts, which we have developed in the form of a video game. This paper is focused on the implementation of stack and queue data structures within our game. A random sample of students have play-tested our game and provided comments on their experience with the playthrough. The feedback we received provides some important insights on the teaching and learning methods used in the classroom.},

abstract={The worldwide demand for software developers are increasing, however, students are facing problems to learn programming at universities. To make things worse, the failure and dropout rates are high, especially in introductory computer programming courses. To address this type of problem, new strategies have been proposed to engage students in programming courses. One strategy is to use game elements to learn programming. Game elements are important for the success or failure of an educational serious game. In the same way, the students' learning process may benefit from proper use of game elements. In this work, we aim to identify and evaluate which game elements contribute to the students' learning in programming education. We performed 19 user studies to investigate the impact on learning of game elements present in two serious games for learning programming. The study was carried out with students from introductory periods of the undergraduate program in Information Systems. Our results identify some game elements that have positive effect on learning programming. The students' feedback also indicates that game elements help them staying focused, engaged and that games are useful complementary resource for learning process.},

abstract={Computer Science contains many abstract concepts, which are both difficult to teach, and to comprehend. Many attempts have been made to help students learn these concepts through visualizations and various teaching techniques; however, these methods are mostly limited to the classroom and do not allow the student time to fully explore the concepts by themselves. By enabling students to interact with the material at their own pace, through an easily accessible and dynamic learning environment, students should be better able to retain and understand the concepts of Computer Science. Binary Search Tree (BST) is an abstract concept which can easily be converted into an interactive format suitable for student self-learning. To see whether an interactive format enhances students learning, a web-based prototype was created. The game consists of forming links between orbs, selecting orbs, copying orbs and removing orbs. This allows for all operations of Binary Search Trees to be explored while presenting the concept in a simple manner. As operations are preformed, and links are made, pseudocode is highlighted in the information menu as a way to reinforce learning and provide context to the operations. In order to measure the effectiveness of the prototype, a pre-survey and a post survey are integrated into the web application.},

abstract={This paper presents a methodology to transpose a physical game into digital and an application to a case study. The case study applied the methodology to teaching and learning for a Data Structures course. The data structures studied involved concepts of stacks, queues, and linked lists.One of the main goals of this research is to confirm that digitalization helps working-class students to learn even having less time to study and experiment. We chose two different private university courses in computer science and computer engineering to take part in this research. The students developed a digital version of a traditional card game. The research bolsters the idea of first understanding the actual game concepts by analyzing and manipulating a physical card game. Using these concepts, students apply their results to examine the data structures perceived in the card game. Later, students develop the same card game using a conventional algorithm. Afterward, the development takes place in the virtual environment, using the Java programming language - we inherited the choice for Java from top hierarchies. We developed the method for transposing the physical game to a digital version before applying this case study. Using this method, students could work and understand each of the data structures concepts. In the end, each student extrapolated its applicability, trying to solve society's problems. As a bonus, students also researched strategies for logical reasoning and critical thinking. Both are necessary for card game resolution and personal and professional development. The results presented show that the students who learned data structures developing this method were able to apply the concepts in the course's evaluations, in their work, in their homes, in their daily lives, and their personal lives. Some students' self-motivation led them to change their social position such that they found themselves improving their quality of life and those around them.},

abstract={Linked lists play an important role in learning basic Computer Science (CS) concepts among a number of different data structures. They are the basis for more complex data structures such as tree data structures. Recursion, stacks and queues can be effectively implemented using linked lists. We observe over the years that our students struggle with linked lists more than some other data structures. While students understand the concepts of stack and queue data structures faster, they need more time to understand and visualize the linked list and its operation algorithms. This paper presents a game-like instructional module called Space Traveler that aims to assist students to better understand and master the concepts of linked lists. Four CS undergraduate students developed it using GameMaker Studio in three months. The Space Traveler game looks like a classic snake game. The game supports practicing the linked list operations such as insertion, search and deletion. This paper presents the game design and implementation in detail and shares our experiences using this module in the CSC2331 Data Structure class at Winston-Salem State University (WSSU) in 2014. This module has been refined based on the feedback from students and instructors. The refined version will be used again in the upcoming semesters. A pretest, a posttest and a survey were developed and used in the evaluation process. In addition, a lab assignment was designed to accompany the game module. Initial assessment outcomes showed very promising student improvements as a result of the use of this game module in the classroom. The module has been made available online to benefit students at other institutions.},

abstract={Computer science majors are expected to learn many concepts related to computer programming. Amongst the concepts are data structures - methods used to arrange and store program-related data. Two commonly-used data structures in computer science are stacks and queues. Traditional instruction promises to instill this knowledge in undergraduate computer science majors. However, students sometimes find it difficult to learn stacks and queues (amongst other CS-related concepts) due to the high complexity of the subject. Emerging research has been exploiting virtual reality and gaming as an educational tool. The game-like appeal that these works feature coupled with educational content motivate students to learn and help students understand that subject at hand. Research investigating educational VR has been demonstrating enhancements in students' learning experience. With this said, a game theme based instructional (GTI) module was developed to teach undergraduate computer science majors about stacks and queues. The module features gaming metaphors to help students construct their own knowledge about the two data structures. In this paper, the GTI module's design is discussed along with a user study involving 18 undergraduate students evaluating it. The user study results prove that the proposed module helps students learn stacks and queues while being satisfactorily usable.},

Um deles é o TuPy Online que, além de possuir recursos para a representação do estado das variáveis em cada etapa da execução de um programa, permite a visualização de estruturas de dados complexas, como grafos ou árvores, em um nível de abstração conveniente. Além disso, a pseudolinguagem emprega um pequeno conjunto de comandos, todos em língua portuguesa, completo o suficiente para expressar qualquer algoritmo. Neste trabalho, apresentamos o TuPy Online e um estudo sobre a usabilidade dessa ferramenta. Também medimos sua influência no processo de aprendizagem de algoritmos.},

Nesta abordagem, além do estudante ter acesso a aplicativos exemplos providos de animações gráficas que ilustram o funcionamento de algoritmos, ele também realiza suas próprias animações durante o processo de implementação da estrutura e dos algoritmos de maneira simplificada mas com visualização gráfica notável e resultados sensivelmente positivos na aprendizagem},
