This work aimed primarily at developing a model for the analysis of viral genomes, based on the use of codons. This tool aims to be a significant resource for investigating species evolution, employing genomic sequences of SARS-COV-2 as the basis for this study. The implementation of this model aims to provide enhanced computational efficiency and achieve more precise results. Additionally, the tool will be capable of presenting graphical visualizations of the obtained results, simplifying data interpretation and assisting in scientific decision-making. It is expected that this approach will provide valuable insights into the evolution of viral species, contributing to the advancement of virology and comparative genomics. The obtained results were considered favorable, given that the model was implemented satisfactorily, meeting all specified objectives.
