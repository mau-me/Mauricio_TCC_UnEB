Write the abstract in a single paragraph. Abstract is the main advertisement of your work. In summary, it should be clear what the research problem is, the objective (hypothetical solution) presented and the main results achieved. Also the relevance (motivation) of the work should be clear. As you read your abstract, put yourself in the reader's place and think: if someone reads this abstract, would him/her be interested in reading the full monograph ? Your abstract will only be good if the answer to this question is YES in most cases.

\textcolor{red}{BE CAREFUL: Your abstract MUST NOT be an automatic translation (Google Translator) of your Portuguese text. You MUST write it again in English. Otherwise it will probably be a very bad text.}
