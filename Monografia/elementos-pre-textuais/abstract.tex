This work aims to develop a model for the analysis of viral genomes based on the use of codons, which will serve as a tool for studying the evolution of species using genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2. It is expected that this approach will enable a more efficient computational process and yield improved results. Additionally, the tool will provide graphical visualization of the results, facilitating data interpretation and supporting scientific decision-making. Through the application of this tool, valuable insights into the evolution of viral species are anticipated, contributing to advancements in virology and comparative genomics. The obtained results are expected to demonstrate the effectiveness of the tool in analyzing and understanding evolutionary patterns in viral species, making it a promising resource for researchers and professionals in the field.
