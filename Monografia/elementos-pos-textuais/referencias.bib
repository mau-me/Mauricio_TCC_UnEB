  abstract = {Phylogenetics is a powerful tool for microbial epidemiology, but it is a tool that is often misused and misinterpreted by the field. Microbial epidemiologists are cautioned that in order to draw any inferences about the order of descent from a common ancestor it is necessary to correctly root a phylogenetic tree. Epidemiological samples of microbial populations typically include both ancestors and their descendants. In order to illustrate the relationships of those isolates, the phylogenetic method used must be able to detect zero-length branches. Unweighted Pair-Group Method (UPGMA) is the phylogenetic method that is most widely used in microbial epidemiology. Because UPGMA cannot detect zero length branches, and because it places the root of the tree based on a usually-false assumption, UPGMA is the worst possible choice among the several phylogenetic methods available. Because microbial epidemiology deals with relationships among strains within a species, rather than with relationships among species, recombination within those species can render phylogenetic trees meaningless and positively misleading. When there is evidence of significant recombination within the species of interest phylogenetic trees should not be used at all. Instead, alternative tools such as eBURST should be used to understand relationships among isolates.}

  abstract = {{For many years, phylogenetics was a topic confined largely to systematics. However, after the “molecular revolution” phylogenies began to permeate nearly every branch of the biological sciences, and they have since become tools that are common throughout mainstream biology. Unfortunately, along with this shift came the realization that phylogenetic trees are prone to misinterpretation. A phylogenetic tree provides a particular type of narrative representation of evolutionary history (O'Hara 1992), and one needs to grasp “tree thinking” to correctly interpret this form of narrative.Systematists tend to take it for granted that a phylogenetic tree is straightforward to interpret. However, in the real world this is clearly not so, and tree thinking cannot be taken for granted (Sandvik 2008). As David Baum and Stacey Smith have noted in their recent book on Tree Thinking (p. xv), the basic issue is that: tree thinking runs counter to standard perceptions of evolution in popular culture. We do not know why it should be so, but we have learned from working with thousands of students that, without contrary training, people tend to have a one-dimensional and progressive view of evolution. We tend to tell evolution as a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Against that backdrop, phylogenetic trees are challenging; they are not linear but branching and fractal, with one beginning and many equally valid ends. Tree thinking is, in short, counterintuitive.}},

Despite individual genome sequence-based analysis, there is a paucity of comparative genomic and evolutionary analysis to provide overarching and comprehensive evolutionary insights. Therefore, we first enriched the existing database of complete genome sequences of SRMVs with Pakistan-originated strains and then explored overall nucleotide diversity, genomic and residue characteristics, and deduced an evolutionary relationship among strains representing a diverse geographical region worldwide. The average number of pairwise nucleotide differences among the whole genomes was found to be 788.690 with a diversity in nucleotide sequences (0.04889 ± S.D. 0.00468) and haplotype variance (0.00001). The RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (L) gene revealed phylogenetic relationship among SRMVs in a pattern similar to those of complete genome and the nucleoprotein (N) gene. Therefore, we propose another useful molecular marker that may be employed for future epidemiological investigations. Based on evolutionary analysis, the mean evolution rate for the complete genome, N, P, M, F, H and L genes of SRMV was estimated to be 9.953*10–4, 1.1*10–3, 1.23*10–3, 2.56*10–3, 2.01*10–3, 1.47*10–3 and 9.75*10–4 substitutions per site per year, respectively. A recombinant event was observed in a Pakistan-originated strain (KY967608) revealing Indian strains as major (98.1\%, KR140086) and minor parents (99.8\%, KT860064). Taken together, outcomes of the study augment our knowledge and current understanding towards ongoing phylogenomic and evolutionary dynamics for better comprehensions of SRMVs and effective disease control interventions.},

  abstract   = {SARS-CoV-2 is a new human coronavirus (CoV), which emerged in China in late 2019 and is responsible for the global COVID-19 pandemic that caused more than 97 million infections and 2 million deaths in 12 months. Understanding the origin of this virus is an important issue, and it is necessary to determine the mechanisms of viral dissemination in order to contain future epidemics. Based on phylogenetic inferences, sequence analysis and structure–function relationships of coronavirus proteins, informed by the knowledge currently available on the virus, we discuss the different scenarios on the origin—natural or synthetic—of the virus. The data currently available are not sufficient to firmly assert whether SARS-CoV2 results from a zoonotic emergence or from an accidental escape of a laboratory strain. This question needs to be solved because it has important consequences on the risk/benefit balance of our interactions with ecosystems, on intensive breeding of wild and domestic animals, on some laboratory practices and on scientific policy and biosafety regulations. Regardless of COVID-19 origin, studying the evolution of the molecular mechanisms involved in the emergence of pandemic viruses is essential to develop therapeutic and vaccine strategies and to prevent future zoonoses.

              Virophages are small viruses with double-stranded DNA genomes that replicate along with giant viruses and co-infect eukaryotic cells. Due to the paucity of virophage reference genomes, a collective understanding of the global virophage diversity, distribution, and evolution is lacking.
              
              Results
              Here we screened a public collection of over 14,000 metagenomes using the virophage-specific major capsid protein (MCP) as “bait.” We identified 44,221 assembled virophage sequences, of which 328 represent high-quality (complete or near-complete) genomes from diverse habitats including the human gut, plant rhizosphere, and terrestrial subsurface. Comparative genomic analysis confirmed the presence of four core genes in a conserved block. We used these genes to establish a revised virophage classification including 27 clades with consistent genome length, gene content, and habitat distribution. Moreover, for eight high-quality virophage genomes, we computationally predicted putative eukaryotic virus hosts.
              
              Conclusion
              Overall, our approach has increased the number of known virophage genomes by 10-fold and revealed patterns of genome evolution and global virophage distribution. We anticipate that the expanded diversity presented here will provide the backbone for further virophage studies.},

              Alignment-free methods of genomic comparison offer the possibility of scaling to large data sets of nucleotide sequences comprised of several thousand or more base pairs. Such methods can be used for purposes of deducing “nearby” species in a reference data set, or for constructing phylogenetic trees.
              
              Results
              We describe one such method that gives quite strong results. We use the Frequency Chaos Game Representation (FCGR) to create images from such sequences, We then reduce dimension, first using a Fourier trig transform, followed by a Singular Values Decomposition (SVD). This gives vectors of modest length. These in turn are used for fast sequence lookup, construction of phylogenetic trees, and classification of virus genomic data. We illustrate the accuracy and scalability of this approach on several benchmark test sets.
              
              Conclusions
              The tandem of FCGR and dimension reductions using Fourier-type transforms and SVD provides a powerful approach for alignment-free genomic comparison. Results compare favorably and often surpass best results reported in prior literature. Good scalability is also observed.},

Thus, it is critical to determine the degree of the variations and in which part of the virus those variations occurred. Therefore, in this study, methods that could be used to vectorize the sequence data, perform clustering analysis, and visualize the results were proposed using machine learning methods. To conduct this study, a total of 224,073 cases of SARS-CoV-2 sequence data were collected through NCBI and GISAID, and the data were visualized using dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis models such as T-SNE and DBSCAN. The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which was first detected, was distinguished from different variations, including Omicron and Delta, in the cluster results. Furthermore, it was possible to examine which codon changes in the spike protein caused the variants to be distinguished using feature importance extraction models such as Random Forest or Shapely Value. The proposed method has the advantage of being able to analyse and visualize a large amount of data at once compared to the existing tree-based sequence data analysis. The proposed method was able to identify and visualize significant changes between the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which was first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and the newly formed mutant virus group. As a result of clustering analysis using sequence data, it was possible to confirm the formation of clusters among various variants in a two-dimensional graph, and by extracting the importance of variables, it was possible to confirm which codon changes played a major role in distinguishing variants. Furthermore, since the proposed method can handle a variety of data sequences, it can be used for all kinds of diseases, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the proposed method has the potential to become widely used for the effective analysis of disease variations.},

  abstract = {Current efforts to reconstruct the tree of life and histories of multigene families demand the inference of phylogenies consisting of thousands of gene sequences. However, for such large data sets even a moderate exploration of the tree space needed to identify the optimal tree is virtually impossible. For these cases the neighbor-joining (NJ) method is frequently used because of its demonstrated accuracy for smaller data sets and its computational speed. As data sets grow, however, the fraction of the tree space examined by the NJ algorithm becomes minuscule. Here, we report the results of our computer simulation for examining the accuracy of NJ trees for inferring very large phylogenies. First we present a likelihood method for the simultaneous estimation of all pairwise distances by using biologically realistic models of nucleotide substitution. Use of this method corrects up to 60\% of NJ tree errors. Our simulation results show that the accuracy of NJ trees decline only by ≈5\% when the number of sequences used increases from 32 to 4,096 (128 times) even in the presence of extensive variation in the evolutionary rate among lineages or significant biases in the nucleotide composition and transition/transversion ratio. Our results encourage the use of complex models of nucleotide substitution for estimating evolutionary distances and hint at bright prospects for the application of the NJ and related methods in inferring large phylogenies.},

It is now the top-priority pathogen to be dealt with due to its high transmissibility, severe illness and associated mortality, absence of effective prophylactic and therapeutic measures with knowledge gaps in human epidemiology, immunity and pathogenesis. To meet the increasing demand of the diagnostic and clinical services, it is necessary to improve biosafety and expand laboratory capabilities since the existing laboratories and workers cannot meet the emerging demand. This article highlights the risk class and biosafety consensus of the minimum requirements for the SARS-COV-2 clinical and diagnostic laboratories, as well as, the prevention of the biorisk to the workers, avoiding accidental dissemination to their families and the community.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},

Vaccine numbers are limited so this study aimed to inform their prioritization by modelling.The primary outcome was the number needed to vaccinate (NNV) to prevent one COVID-19-related death in 1 year. NNVs were based on postoperative SARS-CoV-2 rates and mortality in an international cohort study (surgical patients), and community SARS-CoV-2 incidence and case fatality data (general population). NNV estimates were stratified by age (18–49, 50–69, 70 or more years) and type of surgery. Best- and worst-case scenarios were used to describe uncertainty.NNVs were more favourable in surgical patients than the general population. The most favourable NNVs were in patients aged 70 years or more needing cancer surgery (351; best case 196, worst case 816) or non-cancer surgery (733; best case 407, worst case 1664). Both exceeded the NNV in the general population (1840; best case 1196, worst case 3066). NNVs for surgical patients remained favourable at a range of SARS-CoV-2 incidence rates in sensitivity analysis modelling. Globally, prioritizing preoperative vaccination of patients needing elective surgery ahead of the general population could prevent an additional 58 687 (best case 115 007, worst case 20 177) COVID-19-related deaths in 1 year.As global roll out of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination proceeds, patients needing elective surgery should be prioritized ahead of the general population.}},
