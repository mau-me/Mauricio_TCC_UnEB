	abstract = {Abstract
            The rapid global spread and dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 has provided the virus with numerous opportunities to develop several variants. Thus, it is critical to determine the degree of the variations and in which part of the virus those variations occurred. Therefore, in this study, methods that could be used to vectorize the sequence data, perform clustering analysis, and visualize the results were proposed using machine learning methods. To conduct this study, a total of 224,073 cases of SARS-CoV-2 sequence data were collected through NCBI and GISAID, and the data were visualized using dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis models such as T-SNE and DBSCAN. The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which was first detected, was distinguished from different variations, including Omicron and Delta, in the cluster results. Furthermore, it was possible to examine which codon changes in the spike protein caused the variants to be distinguished using feature importance extraction models such as Random Forest or Shapely Value. The proposed method has the advantage of being able to analyse and visualize a large amount of data at once compared to the existing tree-based sequence data analysis. The proposed method was able to identify and visualize significant changes between the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which was first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and the newly formed mutant virus group. As a result of clustering analysis using sequence data, it was possible to confirm the formation of clusters among various variants in a two-dimensional graph, and by extracting the importance of variables, it was possible to confirm which codon changes played a major role in distinguishing variants. Furthermore, since the proposed method can handle a variety of data sequences, it can be used for all kinds of diseases, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the proposed method has the potential to become widely used for the effective analysis of disease variations.},

	abstract = {Abstract

              Background
              Alignment-free methods of genomic comparison offer the possibility of scaling to large data sets of nucleotide sequences comprised of several thousand or more base pairs. Such methods can be used for purposes of deducing “nearby” species in a reference data set, or for constructing phylogenetic trees.


              Results
              We describe one such method that gives quite strong results. We use the Frequency Chaos Game Representation (FCGR) to create images from such sequences, We then reduce dimension, first using a Fourier trig transform, followed by a Singular Values Decomposition (SVD). This gives vectors of modest length. These in turn are used for fast sequence lookup, construction of phylogenetic trees, and classification of virus genomic data. We illustrate the accuracy and scalability of this approach on several benchmark test sets.


              Conclusions
              The tandem of FCGR and dimension reductions using Fourier-type transforms and SVD provides a powerful approach for alignment-free genomic comparison. Results compare favorably and often surpass best results reported in prior literature. Good scalability is also observed.},

	abstract = {Abstract

              Background
              Virophages are small viruses with double-stranded DNA genomes that replicate along with giant viruses and co-infect eukaryotic cells. Due to the paucity of virophage reference genomes, a collective understanding of the global virophage diversity, distribution, and evolution is lacking.


              Results
              Here we screened a public collection of over 14,000 metagenomes using the virophage-specific major capsid protein (MCP) as “bait.” We identified 44,221 assembled virophage sequences, of which 328 represent high-quality (complete or near-complete) genomes from diverse habitats including the human gut, plant rhizosphere, and terrestrial subsurface. Comparative genomic analysis confirmed the presence of four core genes in a conserved block. We used these genes to establish a revised virophage classification including 27 clades with consistent genome length, gene content, and habitat distribution. Moreover, for eight high-quality virophage genomes, we computationally predicted putative eukaryotic virus hosts.


              Conclusion
              Overall, our approach has increased the number of known virophage genomes by 10-fold and revealed patterns of genome evolution and global virophage distribution. We anticipate that the expanded diversity presented here will provide the backbone for further virophage studies.},

	abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 is a new human coronavirus (CoV), which emerged in China in late 2019 and is responsible for the global COVID-19 pandemic that caused more than 97 million infections and 2 million deaths in 12 months. Understanding the origin of this virus is an important issue, and it is necessary to determine the mechanisms of viral dissemination in order to contain future epidemics. Based on phylogenetic inferences, sequence analysis and structure–function relationships of coronavirus proteins, informed by the knowledge currently available on the virus, we discuss the different scenarios on the origin—natural or synthetic—of the virus. The data currently available are not sufficient to firmly assert whether SARS-CoV2 results from a zoonotic emergence or from an accidental escape of a laboratory strain. This question needs to be solved because it has important consequences on the risk/benefit balance of our interactions with ecosystems, on intensive breeding of wild and domestic animals, on some laboratory practices and on scientific policy and biosafety regulations. Regardless of COVID-19 origin, studying the evolution of the molecular mechanisms involved in the emergence of pandemic viruses is essential to develop therapeutic and vaccine strategies and to prevent future zoonoses.

              A string of complete genome sequences of
              Small ruminant morbillivirus
              (SRMV) have been reported from different parts of the globe including Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Despite individual genome sequence-based analysis, there is a paucity of comparative genomic and evolutionary analysis to provide overarching and comprehensive evolutionary insights. Therefore, we first enriched the existing database of complete genome sequences of SRMVs with Pakistan-originated strains and then explored overall nucleotide diversity, genomic and residue characteristics, and deduced an evolutionary relationship among strains representing a diverse geographical region worldwide. The average number of pairwise nucleotide differences among the whole genomes was found to be 788.690 with a diversity in nucleotide sequences (0.04889 ± S.D. 0.00468) and haplotype variance (0.00001). The RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (
              L

            There is growing interest in reconstructing phylogenies from the copious amounts of genome sequencing projects that target related viral, bacterial or eukaryotic organisms. To facilitate the construction of standardized and robust phylogenies for disparate types of projects, we have developed a complete bioinformatic workflow, with a web-based component to perform phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary (PhaME) analysis from sequencing reads, draft assemblies or completed genomes of closely related organisms. Furthermore, the ability to incorporate raw data, including some metagenomic samples containing a target organism (e.g. from clinical samples with suspected infectious agents), shows promise for the rapid phylogenetic characterization of organisms within complex samples without the need for prior assembly.},

              Background

                Pigeon circovirus (PiCV) infections in pigeons (
                Columba livia
                ) have been reported worldwide. Currently, pigeon racing is becoming increasingly popular and considered to be a national sport in China, and even, the greatest competitions of racing pigeons are taking place in China. However, there are still no epidemiologic data regarding PiCV infections among racing pigeons in China. The purpose of our study was to provide information of prevalence, genetic variation and evolution of PiCV from racing pigeons in China.



              Results

                To trace the prevalence, genetic variation and evolution of PiCV in sick and healthy racing pigeons, 622 samples were collected from 11 provinces or municipalities in China from 2016 to 2019. The results showed that the positive rate of PiCV was 19.3\% (120/622) at the sample level and 59.0\% (23/39) at the club level, thus suggesting that the virus was prevalent in Chinese racing pigeons. A sequence analysis revealed that the
                cap
                genes of the PiCV strains identified in our study displayed a high genetic diversity and shared nucleotide homologies of 71.9\%–100\% and amino acid homologies of 71.7\%–100\%. 28 and 36 unique amino acid substitutions were observed in the Cap and Rep proteins derived from our PiCV strains, respectively. A cladogram representation of PiCV strains phylogeny based on 90
                cap
                gene sequences showed that the strains in this study could be further divided into seven clades (A, B, C, E, G, H, and I) and some of them were closely related to worldwide strains from different types of pigeons. A large number of recombination events (31 events) were also detected in the PiCV genomes from Chinese racing pigeons.



              Conclusions
              These findings indicate that PiCV strains circulating in China exhibit a high genetic diversity and also contribute to information of prevalence, genetic variation and evolution of PiCV from racing pigeons in China.},
