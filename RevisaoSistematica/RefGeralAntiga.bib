In this Review, we describe the basic virology of SARS-CoV-2, including genomic characteristics and receptor use, highlighting its key difference from previously known coronaviruses. We summarize current knowledge of clinical, epidemiological and pathological features of COVID-19, as well as recent progress in animal models and antiviral treatment approaches for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also discuss the potential wildlife hosts and zoonotic origin of this emerging virus in detail.},

	abstract = {Since the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly widespread worldwide becoming one of the major global public health issues of the last centuries. Currently, COVID-19 vaccine rollouts are finally upon us carrying the hope of herd immunity once a sufficient proportion of the population has been vaccinated or infected, as a new horizon. However, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants brought concerns since, as the virus is exposed to environmental selection pressures, it can mutate and evolve, generating variants that may possess enhanced virulence. Codon usage analysis is a strategy to elucidate the evolutionary pressure of the viral genome suffered by different hosts, as possible cause of the emergence of new variants. Therefore, to get a better picture of the SARS-CoV-2 codon bias, we first identified the relative codon usage rate of all Betacoronaviruses lineages. Subsequently, we correlated putative cognate transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNAs) to reveal how those viruses adapt to hosts in relation to their preferred codon usage. Our analysis revealed seven preferred codons located in three different open reading frame which appear preferentially used by SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the tRNA adaptation analysis indicates a wide strategy of competition between the virus and mammalian as principal hosts highlighting the importance to reinforce the genomic monitoring to prompt identify any potential adaptation of the virus into new potential hosts which appear to be crucial to prevent and mitigate the pandemic.},

The computer-based representation of "things" in the real world is at the heart of today’s virtual engineering practices. Digital Twin (DT) is a term that receives significant attention in academia and business within this domain. Despite its appealing metaphorical strength, people use it to describe quite different applications with specific conceptual backgrounds, goals and approaches. This paper aims to provide a first systematic classification about DT applications to support follow-up research. The first part of this paper focuses on three application cases described in the academic literature. It analyzes their conceptual background, the targeted problem and the implemented use case. The result of this analysis are seven dimensions that categorize the presented DT applications.

	abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which first occurred in Wuhan (China) in December of 2019, causes a severe acute respiratory illness with a high mortality rate, and has spread around the world. To gain an understanding of the evolution of the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2, we herein analyzed the codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, we compared the codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 with that of other viruses belonging to the subfamily of Orthocoronavirinae. We found that SARS-CoV-2 has a high AU content that strongly influences its codon usage, which appears to be better adapted to the human host. We also studied the evolutionary pressures that influence the codon usage of five conserved coronavirus genes encoding the viral replicase, spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. We found different patterns of both mutational bias and natural selection that affect the codon usage of these genes. Moreover, we show here that the two integral membrane proteins (matrix and envelope) tend to evolve slowly by accumulating nucleotide mutations on their corresponding genes. Conversely, genes encoding nucleocapsid (N), viral replicase and spike proteins (S), although they are regarded as are important targets for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs, tend to evolve faster in comparison to the two genes mentioned above. Overall, our results suggest that the higher divergence observed for the latter three genes could represent a significant barrier in the development of antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.},

There exists a strong positive correlation between codon usage and tRNA content in both organisms, and the extent of this correlation relates to the protein production levels of individual genes. Codon-choice patterns are believed to have been well conserved during the course of evolution. Examination of silent substitutions and tRNA populations in Enterobacteriaceae revealed that the evolutionary constraint imposed by tRNA content on codon usage decelerated rather than accelerated the silent-substitution rate, at least insofar as pairs of taxonomically related organisms were examined. Codon-choice patterns of multicellular organisms are briefly reviewed, and diversity in G+C percentage at the third position of codons in vertebrate genes--as well as a possible causative factor in the production of this diversity--is discussed.},

The genome has a length of {\textasciitilde}29.9 kbps, which encodes for genes that are essential for cell survival and replication. Different evolutionary constraints constantly influence the codon usage bias (CUB) of different genes. A virus optimizes its codon usage to fit the host environment on which it savors. This study is a comprehensive analysis of the CUB for the different genes encoded by viruses of the Coronaviridae family. Different methods including relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), an Effective number of codons (ENc), parity plot 2, and Neutrality plot, were adopted to analyze the factors responsible for the genetic evolution of the Coronaviridae family. Base composition and RSCU analyses demonstrated the presence of A-ended and U-ended codons being preferred in the 3rd codon position and are suggestive of mutational selection. The lesser ENc value for the spike ‘S’ gene suggests a higher bias in the codon usage of this gene compared to the other structural genes. Parity plot 2 and neutrality plot analyses demonstrate the role and the extent of mutational and natural selection towards the codon usage pattern. It was observed that the structural genes of the Coronaviridae family analyzed in this study were at the least under 84\% influence of natural selection, implying a major role of natural selection in shaping the codon usage.},

	abstract = {By considering the nucleotide sequence of several highly expressed coding regions in bacteriophage MS2 and mRNAs. from Escherichia coli, it is possible to deduce some rules which govern the selection of the most appropriate synonymous codons NNU or NNC read by tRNAs having GNN, QNN or INN as anticodon. The rules fit with the general hypothesis that an efficient in-phase translation is facilitated by proper choice of degenerate codewords promoting a codon-anticodon interaction with intermediate strength (optimal energy) over those with very strong or very weak interaction energy. Moreover, codons corresponding to minor tRNAs are clearly avoided in these efficiently expressed genes. These correlations are clearcut in the normal reading frame but not in the corresponding frameshift sequences +1 and + 2. We hypothesize that both the optimization of codon-anticodon interaction energy and the adaptation of the population to codon frequency or vice versa in highly expressed mRNAs of E. coli are part of a strategy that optimizes the efficiency of translation. Conversely, codon usage in weakly expressed genes such as represser genes follows exactly the opposite rules. It may be concluded that, in addition to the need for coding an amino acid sequence, the energetic consideration for codon-anticodon pairing, as well as the adaptation of codons to the tRNA population, may have been important evolutionary constraints on the selection of the optimal nucleotide sequence.},

In contrast, there is little correlation between the degree of codon bias and the rate of protein evolution.

At the molecular level, coronaviruses employ a variety of unusual strategies to accomplish a complex program of gene expression. Coronavirus replication entails ribosome frameshifting during genome translation, the synthesis of both genomic and multiple subgenomic RNA species, and the assembly of progeny virions by a pathway that is unique among enveloped RNA viruses. Progress in the investigation of these processes has been enhanced by the development of reverse genetic systems, an advance that was heretofore obstructed by the enormous size of the coronavirus genome. This review summarizes both classical and contemporary discoveries in the study of the molecular biology of these infectious agents, with particular emphasis on the nature and recognition of viral receptors, viral RNA synthesis, and the molecular interactions governing virion assembly.},

However, identification of the various BK virus subtypes/subgroups is a long and delicate process on the basis of currently available data. Therefore, we wanted to define a simple and effective one-step strategy for characterizing all BK virus strains from the VP1 gene sequence. Based on the analysis of 199 available complete DNA VP1 sequences, phylogenetic trees, alignments, and isolated polymorphisms were used to define an effective strategy for distinguishing the 12 different BK virus subtypes/subgroups. Based on the 12 subtypes identified from the 199 complete BKV VP1 sequences (1,089 bp), 60 mutations that can be used to differentiate these various subtypes/subgroups were identified. Some genomic areas were more variable and comprised mutational hot spots. From a subregion of only 100 bp in the VP1 region (1977 through 2076), we therefore constructed an algorithm that enabled rapid determination of all BKV subtypes/subgroups with 99\% agreement (197/199) relative to the complete VP1 sequence. We called this domain of the BK viral genome the BK typing and grouping region (BKTGR). Finally, we validated our viral subtype identification process in a population of 100 transplant recipients with 100\% efficiency. The new simpler method of BKV subtyping/subgrouping reported here constitutes a useful tool for future studies that will help us to more clearly understand the impact of BKV subtypes/subgroups on diagnosis, infection, and BK virus-associated diseases.},

	abstract = {We survey agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithms and discuss efficient implementations that are available in R and other software environments. We look at hierarchical self-organizing maps, and mixture models. We review grid-based clustering, focusing on hierarchical density-based approaches. Finally, we describe a recently developed very efficient (linear time) hierarchical clustering algorithm, which can also be viewed as a hierarchical grid-based algorithm. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Commonly hepatitis E virus (HEV) sequences are genotyped phylogenetically using sub genomic sequences. This paper examines this practice with Orthohepevirus A sequences. As the length of sequences becomes progressively shorter the number of identical sequences in an alignment tends to increase; however these sequences don’t lose their genotypic identity down to 100 nucleotides in length. The best substitution models tend to become less parametrized, bootstrap support decreases and trees created from short sub genomic fragments are less likely to be isomorphic with trees from longer sub genomic fragments or complete genome sequences. However, it is still possible to correctly genotype sequences using fragments as small as 200 nucleotides. While it is possible to correctly genotype sequences with short sub genomic sequences, the estimates of evolutionary relationships between genotypes degrade to such extent that sequences below 1600 nucleotides long cannot be used to reliably study these relationships, and comparisons of trees from different sub genomic regions with little or no sequence overlap can be problematic. Subtyping may be done but requires a careful examination of the region to be used to ensure it correctly resolves subtypes.},
